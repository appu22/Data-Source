    <p>What is Twitter Bootstrap?
        Bootstrap is a sleek, intuitive, and powerful, mobile first front-end framework for faster
        and easier web development. It uses HTML, CSS, and Javascript.
        Bootstrap was developed by Mark Otto and Jacob Thornton at Twitter. It was released as
        an open source product in August 2011 on GitHub.
        Why Use Bootstrap?
         Mobile first approach: Bootstrap 3 framework consists of Mobile first styles
        throughout the entire library instead of them in separate files.
         Browser Support: It is supported by all popular browsers.
         Easy to get started: With just the knowledge of HTML and CSS anyone can get
        started with Bootstrap. Also the Bootstrap official site has a good documentation.
         Responsive design: Bootstrap's responsive CSS adjusts to Desktops, Tablets
        and Mobiles. More about the responsive design is in the chapter Bootstrap
        Responsive Design.
         Provides a clean and uniform solution for building an interface for developers.
         It contains beautiful and functional built-in components which are easy to
        customize.
         It also provides web-based customization.
         And best of all it is an open source.

        What Bootstrap Package Includes?
         Scaffolding: Bootstrap provides a basic structure with Grid System, link
        styles, and background. This is covered in detail in the section Bootstrap
        Basic Structure.
         CSS: Bootstrap comes with the feature of global CSS settings, fundamental
        HTML elements styled and enhanced with extensible classes, and an
        advanced grid system. This is covered in detail in the section Bootstrap with
        CSS.
         Components: Bootstrap contains over a dozen reusable components built
        to provide iconography, dropdowns, navigation, alerts, pop-overs, and much
        more. This is covered in detail in the section Layout Components.
         JavaScript Plugins: Bootstrap contains over a dozen custom jQuery plugins.
        You can easily include them all, or one by one. This is covered in details in the
        section Bootstrap Plugins.
         Customize: You can customize Bootstrap's components, LESS variables, and
        jQuery plugins to get your very own version.

        2. Bootstrap ─ Environment Setup
        It is very easy to setup and start using Bootstrap. This chapter will explain how to
        download and setup Bootstrap. We will also discuss the Bootstrap file structure, and
        demonstrate its usage with an example.
        DownloadBootstrap
        You can download the latest version of Bootstrap from http://getbootstrap.com/. When
        you click on this link, you will get to see a screen as below:
        Here you can see two buttons:
         Download Bootstrap: Clicking this, you can download the precompiled
        and minified versions of Bootstrap CSS, JavaScript, and fonts. No documentation or
        original source code files are included.
         Download Source: Clicking this, you can get the latest Bootstrap LESS
        and JavaScript source code directly from GitHub.
        If you work with Bootstrap's uncompiled source code, you need to compile the LESS files
        to produce usable CSS files. For compiling LESS files into CSS, Bootstrap officially
        supports only Recess, which is Twitter's CSS hinter based on less.js.
        For better understanding and ease of use, we shall use precompiled version of Bootstrap
        throughout the tutorial. As the files are complied and minified, you don't have to bother
        every time including separate files for individual functionality. At the time of writing this
        tutorial the latest version (Bootstrap 3) was downloaded.</p>
